TIC-TAC-TOE
## Introduction
1. This is a simple tic-tac-toe game made in C language :
The game is to be played between two people (in this program between HUMAN and COMPUTER).
One of the player chooses ‘O’ and the other ‘X’ to mark their respective cells.
The game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has one whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective character (‘O’ or ‘X’).
If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw.
2. Our project name is Tic-Tac-Toe game. This game is very popular and is
fairly simple by itself. It is actually a two player game. In this game, there is
a board with n x n squares. In our game, it is 3 x 3 squares.
The goal of Tic-Tac-Toe is to be one of the players to get three same
symbols in a row - horizontally, vertically or diagonally - on a 3 x 3 grid

## RESEARCH

It is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees. It is straightforward to write a computer program to play tic-tac-toe perfectly or to enumerate the 765 essentially different positions (the state space complexity) or the 26,830 possible games up to rotations and reflections (the game tree complexity) on this space. If played optimally by both players, the game always ends in a draw, making tic-tac-toe a futile game.

## FEATURES
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
